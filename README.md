Naan Mudhalvan Project-SmartEvac

Problem Statement: Design and develop an efficient Evacuation Planning System that can generate optimal evacuation routes and shelter allocations for affected populations during natural disasters or emergencies, taking into account factors such as population density, infrastructure, disaster severity, and resource availability, with the goal of minimizing response time, reducing casualties, and ensuring the safety and well-being of individuals.

Project description:The SmartEvac project aims to transform emergency evacuation strategies using artificial intelligence, real-time geospatial data, and predictive modeling. In its final phase, SmartEvac integrates advanced routing algorithms, crowd density analysis, and IoT-enabled hazard monitoring to provide dynamic evacuation guidance during natural or human-made disasters. This document offers a comprehensive report on the projectâ€™s completion, covering the live demonstration, technical documentation, performance evaluation, codebase, and testing outcomes. Designed for scalability and interoperability with emergency management systems, SmartEvac ensures rapid, informed decisions in crisis scenarios. System diagrams, heatmaps, and code snapshots will be included to thoroughly demonstrate the system's architecture and operational flow.
